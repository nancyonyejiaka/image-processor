USEME VERSION 3.0.0:
    HOW TO: load
        - navigate to the section of the GUI titled "How would you like to process this image?"
        - navigate to the section titled "Choose a new image to edit or save your current image:"
        - click the "Load" button
        - in the file opener pop-up menu, navigate to the directory that the desired is saved to
        - in the file opener pop-up menu, click the image you would like to open
        - double-click the file or click the "Open" button in the bottom right corner of the pop-up

    After the file has been opened, it may take a few seconds for the image load onto the program,
    especially for larger images. Once the image has been loaded onto the program, the image will
    be displayed directly under the "Currently editing this image: " header, to the left of the
    section title "Color Distribution Histogram". If the dimensions of the image are too big to
    fit in the designated area, the user may use horizontal and vertical scroll bars.


    HOW TO: save
        - navigate to the section of the GUI titled "How would you like to process this image?"
        - navigate to the section titled "Choose a new image to edit or save your current image:"
        - click the "Save" button
        - in the file opener pop-up menu, navigate to the direction that you would like to save
          your image to
        - in the text box labeled "Save As: " at the top of the file opener pop-up menu, specify
          a file path and file extension (either .jpg, .png, .bmp, or .ppm) that you would like to
          save the image under
        - click the "Save" button in the bottom right corner of the pop-up


    HOW TO: apply image modification command (not brighten or darken)
        - load in an image, such that it appears in the editing window (instructions given above)
        - navigate down to the section of the GUI titled
          "What effects would you like to add to your current image:"
        - press the button that corresponds to the effect you would like to apply


    HOW TO: brighten or darken
        - load in an image, such that it appears in the editing window (instructions given above)
        - navigate down to the section of the GUI titled
          "What effects would you like to add to your current image:"
        - enter a valid integer (negative or positive) into the text box, then press the
          'brighten' button if you wish to brighten the image or the 'darken' button if you wish
          to darken the image


    HOW TO: select a histogram view to display
        - load in an image, such that it appears in the editing window (instructions given above)
        - the program will default to showing you the histogram for all color component data
        - in the selection of buttons underneath the histogram, select the graph you wish to view


    HOW TO: use provided JAR file
        - if you wish to open the GUI from the JAR file, simply double click the file to open the
          no argument version of instantiating the program.  This will open the GUI version.

USEME VERSION 1.0.0:

This program supports a variety of image processing and enhancement commands. The current support
functions include:
    - load image-path image-name
    - save image-path image-name
    - brighten increment image-name dest-image-name
    - horizontal-flip image-name dest-image-name
    - vertical-flip image-name dest-image-name
    - red-component image-name dest-image-name
    - blue-component image-name dest-image-name
    - green-component image-name dest-image-name
    - value-component image-name dest-image-name
    - luma-component image-name dest-image-name
    - intensity-component image-name dest-image-name
    - sepia image-name dest-image-name
    - greyscale image-name dest-image-name
    - blur image-name dest-image-name
    - sharpen image-name dest-image-name
    - menu

Before any other commands are typed, you will need to use the load command to load image types into
the program, stored under the 'image-name' within.  Once this is completed accurately, you can
proceed to use any of the other commands to create new images within the program that copy and then
modify what's been loaded in.  None of the modification commands need to be typed in any order,
though when wishing to save a finished image, all modifications must be complete before saving
the image data stored at the 'image-name' to the provided file path, else the changes will not save.
Saved files can be of any supported image type - i.e., .ppm, .jpg, .bmp, or .png.  These can be
loaded in to the program from any source, and output as any source too.

It is possible to pass a text file in via the command line to run our program.  This must be done
by editing the given run configuration, and passing in as the argument "-file name-of-script.txt"
where name-of-script is replaced in the name of the txt file you would like the program to read
scripts from.  One consideration you need to make is that unless your text file is within the
exact scope of the main class, you need to provide more information than name-of-script.txt.  You
would to provide the path as well.  In other words, the text file that the program will read
scripts from must be contained in the dominating project folder (in this case IME) and no other
directories. If the text file is located in director or package within the dominating project file,
the contain root file path must be specified.

For example, say we have a file menu-script.txt, that we would like this program to read from. If
we place the menu-script.txt file only in the IME project folder and no other directories, we can
create a new run configuration with the command line arguments as "-file menu-script.txt", and the
program will successfully read the scripts in the menu-script.txt then exit the program.

If the menu-script.txt is placed within the src director in the IME project folder, we would need
to create a new run configuration with the command line arguments as "-file src/menu-script.txt".

The same applies to the use of the JAR file in the terminal. If the file source for the scripts is
in the same location as the jar file, then the path name does not need to be specified. For
example, if the JAR file and the script text file are both on your desktop, the file path for the
script text file does not need to be specified. Otherwise, the file path for the script text file
must be specified.


EXAMPLES OF SCRIPTS
Enter these when running ImageProcessor or Jar file to use commands.

"load src/cs3500/imageprocessing/res/Square.ppm square3x3
red-component square3x3 red3x3
horizontal-flip red3x3 red3x3horiz
vertical-flip red3x3horiz
red3x3vert brighten 20 red3x3vert red3x3bright
save src/cs3500/imageprocessing/res/sqrredflip.ppm red3x3bright"

In this example, load is called first.  Then, all the modifications are applied.  Finally, save is
called on the most modified image and saved to the given filepath.

"load src/cs3500/imageprocessing/res/small-sammie-submit.png sandwich
blur sandwich sandwichBlurred
sepia sandwichBlurred sandywichBlurred
save src/cs3500/imageprocessing/res/finalSandwich.bmp sandywichBlurred"
